# potato_disease_detection_deep_learning
Two types of disease that potato plants are suffering are "Early Blight" and "Late Blight".

Early Blight is caused by fungus and Late blight is caused by a specific micro-organism.

We will use Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural network to solve this problem

Dataset:
source: Kaggle Plan village
we only need three directories namely
potato__Early_blight
potato__Late_blight
potato__healthy
